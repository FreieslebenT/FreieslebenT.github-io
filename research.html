	<h1>Research</h1>
	<h2>Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are fields whose foundations are still being built.
	 My goal in conducting research is to lay as solid foundations as possible so that ML and AI are reliable tools that benefit rather than harm society. 
	 My approach combines philosophical conceptual analysis with rigourous mathematical modeling. 
	 I consider myself a mediator between disciplines: I am a philosopher close to AI practice, and a philosophically inspired AI researcher;
	 but faculty lines are so 20th century anyway.
	 </br></br>
	 I am particularly interested in the use of AI in the sciences and as a new tool in modeling natural processes. 
	 I am concerned with both the opportunities for gaining new insights and the dangers 
	 of drawing wrong conclusions with little causal understanding. 
	 Other topics I enjoy working on are algorithmic recourse, adversarial examples and robustness. 
	At the moment, I am wrapping my head around ML auditing, algorithmic fairness and the ethics of AI.
	</br></br>
	I am too lazy to keep an up-to-date list of my papers here, but you can find an always up-to-date list of my publications in
	my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BUvMXaAAAAAJ&hl=en'  target="_blank">Google Scholar profile</a>.
